# Project Title: AR Poster Reader

#### A. Introduction/Background
Accenture is an experienced firm which provides professional strategy, technology and consulting services for clients all over the world and have long term cooperation with Australia’s most successful organisations. Accenture is dedicated to helping clients gain initiative in market competition and turn the client’s ideas to business values. 

The traditional printed poster and pamphlets waste natural resources and are hard to update outdated information. As a result, they are usually expensive, inefficient, unattractive and environmentally impactful. However, digital posters with AR technology can help to solve these problems and give clients a new reading experience

#### B. Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a mobile phone-based application for AR poster viewing to solve the problems of traditional posters.

In addition, through this project, we want to gain experience in real-world business methodologies, issue analysing and application development.

#### C. Scope of Work
In the next three months, we will work to do the researches about the issues, analyse clients’ requirement, design the project, develop each function of the application, do both internal and external testing. The final application would contain the main functions of poster scanning, poster viewing, poster saving and sharing.
