# Project Title: AR Poster Reader

#### A. Introduction/Background
Accenture is an experienced firm which provides professional strategy, technology and consulting services for clients all over the world and have long term cooperation with Australia’s most successful organisations. Accenture is dedicated to helping clients gain initiative in market competition and turn the client’s ideas to business values.

Traditional printed posters/pamphlets waste natural resources and are difficult to update when information becomes outdated. As a result, they are usually expensive, inefficient, unattractive and environmentally impactful. However, digital posters with AR technology can help to solve these problems and give clients a new and engaging reading experience.


#### B. Objectives
The objective of this project is to further develop the mobile phone-based application for AR poster viewing to solve the problems of traditional posters of physical limits, as we want to obtain more information about the poster and modify the poster to latest one, not the unchanged and limited one. Last semester, all the initial features has been built, and achieved good output.

In addition, for this semester, through this project, we want to gain further experience in real-world business methodologies, issue analysing and application development to make the application more attractive, intelligent and user-friendly.


#### C. Scope of Work
In the next three months, throughout the project, we will research on better UI , faster response(through new server), more intelligent (through machine learning), more user-friendly (through the overall improvement of user experience), internal and external testing (fix possible bugs). The final application would contain the main functions of poster viewing through scanning the physical poster, but also viewing a poster in diverse way, poster saving, sharing and updating, and recommendation posters through favorite

## Stakeholders
### Accenture: Supporting Development

#### What they do / How they Interact
Accenture is a company that focuses on improving existing organisations business models and driving entrepreneurship. They interact with the project through supporting and guiding the AR poster reader’s development.

#### Expectations
Accenture expects to have a professional proof of concept application developed by the end of the semester that solves the problem statement. This application would utilise AR technology to display a digital poster which is personalisable to the user and allow for an interactive experience.

#### Improvements
Accenture will be able to provide extended support to improve existing companies.

### University Students: User

#### What they do / How they Interact
As per instructions by Accenture, we were to focus on developing using a use case where the users are university students. University students focus on viewing the posters for entertainment, educational or academic purposes. They interact with the project though downloading the app and using it to view the AR posters.

#### Expectations
Students expect the application would utilise AR technology to display a digital poster which is personalisable to the user and allow for an interactive experience.

#### Improvements
Students can obtain relevant details that cannot be covered by a traditional poster.

### Poster Provider: Business Partner

#### What they do / How they Interact
The poster provider is an individual/organisation that is interested in advertising an event or product. They interact with the project through supplying a digital poster design that could be displayed through the application.

#### Expectations
The business partner expects a service to display their digital poster. The service includes accepting a certain form of digital poster, displaying said poster on an application through AR technology and providing a platform for sharing the poster. The poster provider will also have access to feature allowing them to update the information on their posters.

#### Improvements
The business partner may save cost by minimizing the waste, such as reprinting a poster due to an update or minimizing the copy of the posters to print. It is possible for the business partner to display and give information to user in diverse ways and allows for a more interactive user engagement.

## Product Summary
### What has been done :
Last semester, AR Poster Reader has successfully developed a mobile application, HeyPoster. It utilises augmented reality technology to recognise poster and display key information from the poster while providing an interaction between a poster and a user.

For the convenience of users, user can create their own account, upload and favorite posters. 

User interface was also developed in reasonable manner. Thus, users can easily recognize their functionality.

### What to do now :
The AR Poster Reader team should aim to improve on user interface and provide further features that will differentiate the application to traditional paper poster. The team should work on customer research, user testing, update function, data analysis and personalisation. Thus, the application can attract more customers.
